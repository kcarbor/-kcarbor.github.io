Hey there! I'm Kevin Baum, a passionate ethicist (M.A.) and computer scientist (M.Sc.) at the forefront of exploring the ethical dimensions of AI. Recently, I successfully defended my dissertation in Philosophy.

At DFKI, I lead efforts to ensure AI development aligns with societal standards.  
In January 2023, I became deputy head of the¬†research department for¬†[Neuro-Mechanistic Modeling](https://www.dfki.de/nmm)¬†at the [German Research Center for Artifical Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web) and in December 2023, I became head of the [Center for European Research in Trusted AI (CERTAIN)](https://certain.dfki.de).

**Research Interests:** <br>

üîçü§ñ Much of my interdisciplinary work navigates the intricate relationship between AI's __perspicuity attributes__ ‚Äî such as transparency and explainability ‚Äî and __societal desiderata__ including closing responsible gaps, enabling effective human oversight, and allowing to detect algorithmic unfairness. In addition to my work at DFKI, I am pursuing these questions primarily within two projects I am associated with, on the one hand the [*Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 248* "Foundations of Perspicuous Software Systems" within the Center for Perspicuous Computing (CPEC)](https://www.perspicuous-computing.science/), and on the other hand the highly interdisciplinary project [*Explainable Intelligent Systems* (EIS)](https://explainable-intelligent.systems/), which is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. 

üñ•Ô∏èüìä More recently, I started to do research in the computer science side of things with respect to __algorithmic fairness__ and the quest for __explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)__, with a keen interest in the emerging field of __mechanistic interpretability__. In particular, together with my colleagues at [CERTAIN](https://certain.dfki.de), I am researching how those AI system properties that are commonly subsumed under the label __"Trustworthy AI"__ are operationalized and certified and how this can contribute to appropriate trust in AI and a __healthy trust infrastructure__.

ü§ñüìú My research extends into __machine ethics__, i.e., the quest of integrating moral considerations within AI agents' decision-making frameworks. A significant area of inquiry is embedding __normative reasoning into reinforcement learning architectures__, aiming to create AI agents that __learn sensitivity to normative reasons__. Recently, I revistited the __AI alignment__ research.

üë®‚Äçüè´üìò I also engage with the field of __AI ethics__ understood as a subfield of __applied ethics__ more generally. I contribute to the formulation of __ethical guidelines__ for AI development and ponder on effective methodologies for __ethical education for computer science students and professionals__. Notably, our course [*Ethics for Nerds*](https://dcms.cs.uni-saarland.de/ethics_23/) won the ["Hochschulperle des Jahres" award from the *German Stifterverband* in 2019](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/piece-of-news/stifterverband-hochschulperle-des-jahres-2019-fuer-ethics-for-nerds/), which recognizes innovative teaching in higher education.


**What else I do:** <br>

Besides all that, I have also gained practical experience in the __ethical assessment of research projects__, be it as a member and deputy chairman of the [*Commission for the Ethics of Security-Relevant Research* ("Kommission f√ºr die Ethik sicherheitsrelevanter Forschung", KEF)](https://www.uni-saarland.de/verwaltung/wissenschaftliche-integritaet/sicherheitsrelevante-forschung.html) at *Saarland University* (UdS) (from 2020 to 2022), as a member of the [*Ethical Review Board* (ERB)](https://erb.cs.uni-saarland.de/) of *Saarbr√ºcken Informatics Campus* (SIC), or as [__ethical advisor__ of the *DFKI Ethics Team*](https://www.dfki.de/web/ueber-uns/governance/ethik-team) and for an (undisclosed) EU Horizon 2020 project. I am also co-founder of the non-profit association [*Algoright*](https://algoright.de/), an __interdisciplinary think tank__ for good digitalization, which is primarily dedicated to __science communication and ethical consulting__. In addition, I was a permanent expert member for digital ethics of the [__Saarland State Parliament's Enquete Commission__ on *Digitalization in Saarland*](https://www.landtag-saar.de/Downloadfile.ashx?FileId=64456&FileName=So16_1902.pdf).
